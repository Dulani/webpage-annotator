# webpage-annotator
I want to start building a collection of tools to manage and annotate text (where I can easily store and annotate text).

This will primarily be built with Google's Jules AI

[Try It](https://dulani.github.io/webpage-annotator/index.html)

## How to Use

Welcome to the Text Annotation Tool! You can select text within the content area of the application to highlight it. Click on existing highlights to add comments or change their color.

On mobile devices, you can select text by long-pressing and dragging your finger.
